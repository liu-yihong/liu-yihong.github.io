Discover the insider tips and wisdom from seasoned professors who’ve been on both sides of the hiring table. From crafting the perfect CV to avoiding common pitfalls, our panelists spill the beans on positioning yourself as a standout candidate. Get ready to demystify the opaque world of academic recruiting and supercharge your odds of success. Job hunting in academia can feel like navigating a maze blindfolded. From tailoring application materials to acing interviews, the process requires skill, strategy, and a bit of luck. That’s why my notes from the INFORMS 2023 Minority Issue Forum on the academic job search offer a glimpse behind the curtain. On October 18th, seasoned professors peeled back the veil, sharing their experiences and insights from both sides of the hiring table. Their advice, captured here, sheds light on practices for positioning yourself as an outstanding candidate. From building your CV to avoiding common pitfalls, these tips aim to demystify the opaque world of academic recruiting. With wisdom across fields like engineering and business, my notes provide a look at landing your dream academic job. Though the hunt itself may still prove challenging, arming yourself with this insider knowledge can only help your odds. Disclaimer These notes are a combination of panelists’ talks and my personal interpretation. It reflects not only panelists’ wisdom and my personal bias. It is generally applicable, but may not be always true. I would like to extend my gratitude to the four panelists who generously shared their insights into the academic job search process. Our panelists, Dr. Banafsheh Behzad, Dr. Johanna Amaya, Dr. Muge Capan, and Dr. Robert Dell, brought diverse experiences to the discussion. I’d also like to acknowledge the efforts of our session chairs, Dr. Clara M. Novoa Ramirez and Dr. Diana Ramirez-Rios, for organizing this informative session. Question 1 : What Is Your Experience in the Academic Job Search Process?Our panelists bring a wealth of diverse experiences to the table in the academic job search process. Each of them has held distinct roles in this journey, contributing to a well-rounded perspective: Leadership Roles : Some of our panelists have served as deans or provosts of graduate schools, offering insights into the administrative aspects of academic recruitment. Search Committee Expertise : Others have been actively involved in search committees, making critical decisions about candidate selection and hiring. Transition between Research and Teaching : A few of our panelists began their careers as scientists before transitioning into academia as teaching faculty members, ultimately embarking on the tenure track as assistant professors with a strong focus on research. Balancing Teaching and Research : Additionally, our panelists have experience in both teaching and research positions, giving them a comprehensive view of the expectations and challenges in these roles. This collective expertise ensures that the advice shared during this forum covers a broad spectrum of experiences and positions, making it applicable to a wide range of individuals aspiring to secure their dream academic job. Question 2: What Is the First Document You Look at When Reviewing an Applicant’s Package?Our panelists shared insights on what catches their attention first when reviewing academic job applications. It’s worth noting that different panelists had varying approaches, but the consensus was clear. The CV/Resume : Many panelists begin by examining the applicant’s CV or resume. This is often the starting point because it provides a snapshot of your academic journey. What are they looking for in your CV? Research Topics and Collaborations : They pay close attention to the research topics you’ve committed to and the co-authors you’ve worked with. This gives them insight into your research interests, your fit with the position’s requirements, and your professional connections. The Sequence Matters : If your CV passes the initial test, the review process usually continues with the cover letter, research statement, and teaching statement. Your CV is like the first impression, and the other documents provide a more in-depth understanding of your qualifications. Personalization is Key : Our panelists stressed the importance of personalization throughout your application. They want to know why you’re interested in their school, what specific topics you plan to work on if hired, and who you see yourself collaborating with on those identified topics. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Statement: If the job posting requires a DEI statement, our panelists emphasized the significance of this document. It’s not just about making a general statement on diversity and inclusion, but rather contextualizing your beliefs. Defining DEI : Explain how you define diversity, equity, and inclusion. Personal Connection : Share how DEI matters to you and how it shapes your approach. Integration in Teaching and Research : Illustrate how DEI principles are woven into your teaching and research. The panelists were clear that a “desk reject” (rejection without further consideration) could happen if the DEI statement is required but not submitted. So, don’t overlook this aspect if it’s part of the application requirements. Question 3: What Is the Most Challenging Part of the Job Search Process? Keeping Track of Applications: Several panelists emphasized the difficulty of staying organized throughout the application process. As the number of applications increases, it can become increasingly challenging to manage all the necessary documents, deadlines, and personalization requirements for each school. This includes tailoring your application materials to match the specific needs and preferences of each institution. Choosing the Right Type of School: Another point of discussion revolved around the decision to apply for positions in business schools versus engineering schools. Panelists had differing opinions on this matter. While some believed that there should be no restrictions on the types of schools you consider, it’s crucial to be aware of the differences between these two school types. These distinctions encompass cultural aspects, expectations, deliverables, and tenure criteria. So, when deciding where to apply, it’s vital to consider how well your background and aspirations align with the unique characteristics of the department or school. Strategic Application: Panelists also emphasized the importance of applying strategically. They advised prospective job seekers to have a clear understanding of their goals, reasons for wanting to join a particular school, and how well they fit within the department’s culture. In other words, it’s not just about the quantity of applications, but also about the quality and alignment of your applications with your career aspirations. Question 4: What Are the Dos and Don’ts in the Job Search Process?Dos: Craft an Engaging Elevator Speech: Your elevator speech should succinctly highlight your research interests, achievements, and future plans. Make it captivating and relevant to your field. This is often your first impression, so it’s crucial to grab the committee’s attention. Know the Search Committee Members: Do your homework and familiarize yourself with the members of the search committee. Understand their areas of interest and expertise. This will enable you to tailor your conversation to topics of mutual interest and demonstrate how your skills complement the program’s needs. Don’ts: Don’t Apply Blindly: Avoid applying to institutions that you are absolutely certain you wouldn’t want to join. Your application should be a reflection of your genuine interest in the position and the institution, not a scattergun approach. Don’t Obsess Over Tenure Criteria: While tenure is important, don’t let it overwhelm your job search process. Focus on showcasing your qualifications and fit for the position. Tenure discussions can happen later in the process. Don’t Overdo It in Interviews: It’s important to be yourself during interviews. Trying too hard to impress can come across as insincere. Let your authentic self shine through, allowing the search committee to make an informed judgment. Don’t Exceed Time Limits: Stick to the allotted time when answering interview questions. Finishing on time shows respect for the committee’s schedule and allows them to ask more questions and learn more about you. Avoid Lengthy Publication Lists: When presenting your research profile, avoid overwhelming the committee with a long list of publications. Instead, provide a concise summary of your key takeaways, emphasizing the knowledge, accomplishments, and contributions that are most relevant to the position and the institution. Question 5: Should Applicants from Minority-Represented Groups Conceal Their Background?All panelists unanimously agree that applicants should approach their minority-represented status with transparency and confidence. It is essential to never hide or downplay one’s belonging to a minority group, whether it’s related to culture, background, or ability. These unique characteristics can offer valuable perspectives and contribute to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts within academia. Applicants are encouraged to take pride in what makes them unique and to share how these distinctive aspects are reflected in their research and teaching. There’s no need to feel shy or ashamed about your background or identity. Embracing your true self is key. Instead of trying to conform to a perceived norm, let the match between you and the institution occur naturally. Question 6: What Sets Apart Virtual Interviews from In-Person Interviews?Virtual Interviews as a Marathon: Some of our panelists described virtual interviews, particularly the campus visit ones, as marathon events. This is because in a virtual setting, you don’t have the luxury of time between one-on-one conversations, unlike in-person interviews where you can physically move from one office to another. This tight schedule can make virtual interviews more challenging in terms of time management. The Value of In-Person Connection: On the other hand, some panelists expressed a preference for in-person interviews due to the physical contact and face-to-face experience they offer. Building a personal connection and rapport with interviewers and the campus community can be easier in an in-person setting. Controlling Noise Levels: Regardless of whether it’s a virtual or in-person interview, our panelists emphasized the importance of controlling noise levels during the interview. Background noise or disruptions can detract from your presentation and the panel’s ability to focus, so it’s crucial to find a quiet and distraction-free environment. Adapting to Lecture Modalities: Another important point raised by our panelists was the need for candidates to be aware of the various lecture modalities, such as offline, online, and hybrid teaching, and the evolving student population. As academic job seekers, you should be prepared to adjust your teaching methods to accommodate different lecture formats and cater to diverse student learning styles. Audience Question 1: How to Deliver the First Impression Effectively in the Interview?Panelists emphasized the importance of crafting a powerful first impression during academic job interviews. Think of this impression as a concise collection of keywords that represent you effectively. Here’s a breakdown: Keywords : Your first impression should encapsulate key information, such as your name, university, major, and research interests. These are the fundamental elements that will help interviewers remember you. Conciseness : Keep it short and to the point. Long-winded introductions can dilute your message. Aim for clarity and brevity. Audience Question 2: What Is the Role of Networking?Networking is a crucial element in your academic job search. It can significantly boost your chances of success by increasing your visibility and building connections within the academic community. Here are some key strategies to make the most of networking: Attend Networking Events: Actively participate in networking events, such as conference receptions, workshops, and seminars related to your field. These gatherings provide excellent opportunities to meet potential colleagues and employers. Initiate Conversations: Don’t be passive during these events. Be proactive and engage in meaningful conversations with fellow attendees. Be open to discussing your research, interests, and goals. Leverage Conference Programs: Take advantage of conference programs and directories to identify people you want to connect with. Prioritize those who share your research interests or work in institutions you’re interested in. You can use the conference’s app or website to contact them and propose a meeting. Audience Question 3: Should the Future Plan in the Research Statement Be General and Concise or Very Detailed?Unfortunately the notes are missing for this question. Audience Question 4: How to Determine Desired Qualities in Job Ads With Varying Specificity (e.g., Research and Teaching)?One common challenge for job applicants is understanding what exactly a search committee is looking for in a candidate, especially when job postings vary in specificity. Getting a faculty position approved can be a daunting task for universities. Therefore, even when a job advertisement appears quite vague or general, you should still consider applying. Here’s why: Broad Advertisements: When a job ad is general in nature, it often indicates that the search committee is open to a wide range of candidates. This means you have a chance to throw your hat into the ring and showcase your unique skills, both in research and teaching. Tailoring for Targeted Ads: On the other hand, when a job ad is highly specific, it’s crucial to align your application materials and interview responses with the stated requirements. Dr. Capan advises that you should meticulously tailor your documents and interview pitches to match the job description. This shows that you’ve done your homework and are genuinely interested in the role. Demonstrate Added Value: Regardless of the ad’s specificity, you can also set yourself apart by illustrating what you can bring to the school. Highlight your unique qualities, ideas, or projects that could benefit the institution. Show them how you can be an asset, even if you don’t perfectly match every requirement.

Ramayya Krishnan Carnegie Mellon University The Application JourneyEmbarking on this adventure, I discovered that the consortium is highly selective. This year, the ICIS consortium allowed only one student to be nominated from each university or institution. The application process was a thoughtful exercise, requiring the submission of a summary of my current dissertation in the form of a short paper, which details my research question, motivation, methodologies, and contribution to the Information Systems field. However, the eligibility criteria, application procedures, and selection process may vary from year to year and depend on the conference host (such as ICIS, ECIS, AMCIS, or PACIS). The heart of the selection process lies in the hands of the consortium co-chairs and faculty mentors. They meticulously reviewed each submission, considering the depth and potential impact of the research. Out of numerous submissions, only the top 40 students were selected to participate in the consortium, making it a truly prestigious and competitive opportunity. My Journey TimelineLet’s take a glimpse at the key milestones that shaped my path from program nomination to standing at the doors of the consortium. Date Milestone May 9 Institutional Nomination Submission May 18 Institutional Nomination Announcement May 29 Consortium Nomination Submission July 29 Nomination Acceptance Notification Sep. 12 Visa Application Submission Nov. 29 Visa Approval Dec. 2 Visa &amp; Passport Deliver Dec. 6 Consortium Start Dec. 8 Consortium End Dec. 9 Shuttle to ICIS Consortium CompositionA typical day in the consortium unfolds in three main parts: (a) presentations and discussions; (b) panels and/or keynotes; and (c) networking. While I’ll focus on the first part here, I’ll cover panels and keynote content in the following sections. Networking? Well, you’ve got your own unique way of handling that better than I do! In the first part, we were divided into groups of seven or eight attendees and two or three faculty mentors. Each group member had an hour to present their dissertation research, receive feedback from faculty mentors and fellow group members, and engage in a collective discussion about questions, suggestions, and comments. Before the consortium, I received guidance to prepare slides for a concise ten-minute presentation of my research. The emphasis was on focusing the presentation on questions I grappled with, seeking feedback from mentors and group members. It was assumed that everyone had already reviewed my summary short paper and slides. Additionally, I was expected to familiarize myself with the work of others in my group, preparing constructive feedback to share after their presentations. The time allocation for presentation and discussion was strategically set at ten versus fifty minutes. This ratio favored discussion, proving to be constructive given the preparedness of all participants. The experience contrasted with typical conference presentations where a 20-minute presentation is followed by a brief five-minute discussion. An unexpected and enriching aspect was the exposure to unfamiliar research methodologies through reading my peers’ papers. Yet, I did encounter some challenges. The audience occasionally sought clarification during presentations to offer more insightful feedback. This taught me a crucial lesson – tailoring my presentation to the audience. Making my message intellectually accessible resulted in less confusion and higher engagement, leading to feedback of better quality. Another point of reflection was the wish for electronic feedback from each group member. Juggling notetaking and responding to real-time comments proved challenging. Implementing a system where each member could electronically note and deliver their feedback (e.g., a Word document) would ensure that nothing is missed, and the audience is accountable for carefully reviewing my summary paper.

Students are encouraged to participate fully in these sessions with questions as well as contributions for proving results. At the end of each full day, students will be given questions which will be discussed in the following afternoon session. Students should make a good faith effort to answer as many of the questions as possible before the problem solving session. During the problem solving session, all students should be prepared to offer solutions, advice and encouragement regarding the problems being discussed. Student Deliverables In the last session, there will be a short test that students must complete. This results of this test will be passed along to the respective Ph.D. Coordinators for each area. Furthermore, we stress that material from the bootcamp may return on the preliminary exam that JSOM students take at the end of the first year.Lecture Notes unsplash-logothumbnail by Nathan Dumlao","link":"/2019/09/01/Syllabus-Notes-for-JSOM-Ph-D-Math-Refresher/"},{"title":"Notes for Ph.D. Job Interview Experiences 02-21-2020","text":"Are you a budding academic embarking on the journey to secure a tenure-track position in your field? The path can be challenging, but learning from the experiences of those who have successfully navigated it can be immensely helpful. Here is a brief summary of insights and advice shared by three scholars, Dr. Leila Hosseini, Dr. Sameer Mehta, Dr. Murat Tunc during a panel discussion at the JSOM IS Seminar in 2020. I really appreciate the generous and comprehensive sharing about their job seeking experiences.I also want to thank Dr. Varghese S. Jacob to host this panel.These seasoned professionals offer invaluable guidance to aspiring tenure-track job seekers. Before the Interviews: Preparing for the PositionThe journey begins between July and October when academic institutions typically start posting tenure-track positions. The exact timing may vary depending on your field, so stay vigilant. It’s essential to have your application materials ready before the hiring season kicks off. These materials typically include: Curriculum Vitae (CV): A well-organized document highlighting your academic journey and achievements. Teaching and Research Statements: Clear and concise statements outlining your teaching philosophy and research interests. Teaching Evaluations: Evidence of your teaching effectiveness, if available. Recommendation Letters: Strong letters of recommendation from reputable sources. Paper Copies: Copies of your publications or research papers (requirements may vary by institution). Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Statement: Outlines of your commitment to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia. Remember, only include projects and papers that you’re well-versed in. Additionally, be prepared to succinctly discuss the content of your CV within two minutes. Collaborating with your PhD colleagues can also be beneficial in this preparation phase. Interview I: The Initial EncounterThe first-round interview, whether conducted online or in person at a conference, usually lasts around 30 minutes. This interview typically follows a structured format: Introduce Yourself: Begin by succinctly presenting your research focus and its relevance. Research Landscape: Discuss your research topics and methodologies. Research Details: Articulate why your research is significant and provide specific insights into your work. Additional Research Questions: Be prepared for philosophical inquiries about the Information Systems (IS) field. Share your future research plans, including topics, domains, and methodologies. Familiarize yourself with the faculty members you’d like to work with (at least two). Teaching Questions: Expect questions about your teaching experience, teaching philosophy, and your plans for specific courses. Ask Your Questions: Use this opportunity to inquire about the timeline for decisions. When managing your time during this interview, allocate approximately 90% to research-related topics, 5% to teaching, and 5% to your questions for the interviewers. Use your limited time to convey the key points of your research convincingly and demonstrate why you’re the right fit for the position. Remember to establish connections between your teaching and research. Articulate clear motivations for your choice of teaching domain rather than merely discussing a topic. Avoid making unsupported statements; always provide reasons and justifications. If you’re attending a conference, it’s not only an opportunity to network and make connections but also to prepare your application package. You might find universities actively hiring at these events, so having your materials on hand is crucial. For international institutions, be ready to explain your motivation for seeking a position there clearly. Interview II: The Campus VisitTypically, you’ll receive campus visit invitations after the first-round interviews. Some schools may offer direct invitations without the initial interview, although this is less common. During your campus visit: Dress professionally, adhering to a business suit dress code, especially in a business school setting. Remember, they’re not just looking for a researcher; they want an engaging colleague. Don’t immediately dive into your research; make it exciting and memorable. Incorporate anecdotes, jokes, or stories relevant to your presentation to captivate your audience. Prepare for questions about how your research theory relates to practice and vice versa. Practice answering questions, manage your presentation time effectively, and remember that practice makes perfect. Customize your questions for each institution to demonstrate that you’ve done your research. Familiarize yourself with the faculty’s work and connect your research to their contributions. After the Interviews: Making the Right ChoiceAfter all the interviews, when you’re faced with multiple offers, consider the following factors to make an informed decision: Know Your Goals: Define what you want from your career. Is it the best business school, a strong IS department, productive faculty, or opportunities for collaboration outside IS? Salary and Benefits: Consider the financial aspects of the offers, including salary, benefits, and any additional perks. Culture, Geography, and Personal Factors: Reflect on the institution’s culture, location, and any opportunities it may offer for your spouse or family. Teaching and Service Load: Assess the teaching and service expectations, as well as any requirements for assistant or tenure-track professors. Tenure Criteria: Understand the specific criteria and expectations for earning tenure at each institution. This includes research productivity, teaching performance, and any service obligations. Ensure they align with your career goals and capabilities. SummaryIn conclusion, maximizing your research potential and ensuring your happiness are keys to success in securing a tenure-track position. It’s a competitive journey, but with careful preparation, thoughtful presentation, and consideration of your personal and professional goals, you can increase your chances of landing your dream job in academia.

This task is different from 5-star rating estimation in a sense that only some users’ action behaviors (e.g. purchase, view, like, dislike) are available. This post includes my understanding of these three models.

A user $u$'s preference over an item-set is a function of $u$'s preferences on items in this item-set. For example, $u$'s preference on item-set $\\mathcal{P}$ can be $\\hat{r}_{u \\mathcal{P}} = |\\mathcal{P}|^{-1} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{P}} \\hat{r}_{ui}$. $\\hat{r}_{ui}$ is $u$'s estimated preference on item $i$. A user $u$'s pairwise preference over two item-sets $\\mathcal{P}, \\mathcal{A}$ is defined as $\\hat{r}_{u \\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{A}} = \\hat{r}_{u \\mathcal{P}} - \\hat{r}_{u \\mathcal{A}}$. And in COFISET, the assumption of pairwise preference is $\\hat{r}_{u \\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{A}} = \\hat{r}_{u \\mathcal{P}} - \\hat{r}_{u \\mathcal{A}} > 0, \\mathcal{P} \\subseteq \\mathcal{I}^{tr}_{u}, \\mathcal{A} \\subseteq \\mathcal{I}^{tr} \\setminus \\mathcal{I}^{tr}_{u}$. $\\mathcal{P} \\subseteq \\mathcal{I}^{tr}_{u}$ is a set of items of observed feedback from user $u$ and $\\mathcal{A} \\subseteq \\mathcal{I}^{tr} \\setminus \\mathcal{I}^{tr}_{u}$ is a set of items without observed feedback from user $u$.

BPRH Extended Pairwise Preferences Following COFISET, BPRH extends the pairwise preferences over item-sets. Besides the target action (e.g. purchase), a type of user's action called auxiliary action is introduced. Viewing, liking, and disliking are examples for auxiliary actions. Now the assumption of pairwise preferences in BPRH becomes $\\hat{r}_{u \\mathcal{I}} > \\hat{r}_{u \\mathcal{J}} > \\hat{r}_{u \\mathcal{K}}, \\mathcal{I} \\subseteq \\mathcal{I}_{t}^{u}, \\mathcal{J} \\subseteq \\mathcal{I}_{t}^{oa}, \\mathcal{K} \\subseteq \\mathcal{I}_{n}^{u}$. $\\mathcal{I} \\subseteq \\mathcal{I}_{t}^{u}$ is a set of items with target feedback from user $u$. $\\mathcal{J} \\subseteq \\mathcal{I}_{t}^{oa}$ is a set of items with only auxiliary feedback from user $u$.

This post includes my understadning and interpretation of Bilibili’s business model. Introduction Recent years have certified the rapid emergence and growth of online video communities, e.g. YouTube.com, Facebook Watch, TikTok.com, and bilibili.com, whose services mainly cover video publishing, experiencing, searching, commenting, tipping, marketing, and live-streaming through their Web-based platforms which are accessible via computers and mobile phones.According to the Limelight’s market research towards online video in 2020, viewers spend nearly eight hours per week on average in watching various types of video content, and online video consumption has been enlarged across all age groups. This post focuses on bilibili.com, an iconic and leading online video community for young generations in China. From her 2020 annual report, on average she attracted 202 million monthly active users and 1.2 billion daily video views in the fourth quarter, 5.1 billion monthly interactions, and 5.6 million monthly video submissions by 1.8 million monthly active content creators. This enormous and flourishing pool of users and content creators ensures revenue generation from affiliated mobile games, membership subscription, tipping, advertising, and online shopping. Bilibili.com: An Online Video Community In this section, we dig into bilibili.com, an iconic online video community for young Chinese generations, by approaching her from two aspects: an online video platform and a video-centered community.The online video platform is where content creators publish their videos and users consume videos of their interest. And the social interactions among content creators and users consist of a video-centered community. Overall, an online video community is an online ecosystem among content creators and users around videos.Then we graphically illustrate bilibili.com‘s business model to demonstrate how bilibili.com practices her commercialization efforts. Note that bilibili.com provides mobile App and PC Website entrances, and we mainly exploit the mobile App in this post for clear demonstration and simplicity. An Online Video Platform We walk through the details of how bilibili.com operates as an online video platform in this section. As illustrated in the figure above, two main stakeholders get involved on this video platform: users and content creators. Content creators can upload their videos or start live-streaming, namely professional user generated video (PUGV), which are consumed by users. bilibili.com also offers licensed contents, called occupationally generated videos (OGV), to users from third-party production companies, ranging from TV shows, movies, cartoon to anime.Users can be categorized into three types. Viewers without registration can only watch PUGV.Free registered membership gives users access to watch and comment in PUGV, follow and tip content creators, upload videos, and start live-streaming.In addition to the free membership, premium membership comes with fees, allowing users to enjoy advanced PUGV (e.g., higher resolution, high dynamic range, Dolby audio), OGV, fancy comment emoji, and deals in mobile games and online shopping.Note that content creators at least have free membership. The above figure depicts the home page of bilibili.com‘s mobile App. On the top, users can click the avatar and go to their profile page, search content of interests with keywords in the search box, and check private messages within the inbox.At the bottom, five entrances appear.The category page allows users to view content by predefined channels, e.g., anime, music, dance, video game, education, technology, daily life, food, animal, fashion, movies, and TV shows.The feed page includes all content from users’ followed content creators and advertising.The shopping page is a typical e-commerce site, supplying products related to anime, cartoons, and video games.The profile page integrates users’ profile information, followers and followings, browsing history, favorites of content, uploaded content management, premium membership subscription, and App setting.The rest of the home page is a video waterfall, i.e., a list of videos, which consists of banners, ordinary videos, sponsored videos, and advertising. Clicking on a video will be directed to a typical video page, demonstrated in the figure above. In the video description section, users can follow the focal content creator (e.g. CC1) and go to CC1’s personal page by clicking her avatar. CC1’s personal page has CC1’s basic information including self-introduction and numbers of followers and followings, and a list of all her uploaded videos. Users can also send feedback in the video page, e.g., like or dislike, tipping the focal content creator, adding the focal video into her favorites and sharing this video. The comment section functions as a discussion board, in which registered users can interact with each other by comments and replies. A Video-centered Community bilibili.com establishes its online community upon the social network between content creators and their followers, and discussion boards among users and content creators around videos.Generally, users can click the follow button on a video display page or on the personal page of a content creator, as strong evidence of interest, to become a follower. By doing so, those followers will be notified on their mobile phones and feed page every time the followed content creator commits a new activity, e.g., tweets, live-streaming, or publishing a new video. In the feed page shown above, a user can browse all activities from her followed content creators ordered by posted time, and filter activities by tags. Moreover, a user can also post a tweet-like message, usually text with images, by clicking on the post button in the top-right corner. Note that a user can follow multiple content creators. The figure above uncovers the discussion board (“comments” section) of a video display page.For every uploaded video, all registered users, including content creators, can interact with others in the comment section by leaving comments, replying to others’ comments, providing feedback (like or dislike) on comments, or sharing comments.Comments are in a popularity-ranked sequence by default, or can be ranked by posted time. Taking the top-ranked comment, posted by User 1, in the figure above for example, it is the most popular one since it receives the highest number of likes in this video’s comment section. CC and User 3 replied to User 1 directly, and User 2 responded to the CC’s reply. Each interaction (comment or reply) can be modeled as a directed edge from the sender to the receiver, in a network derived from the discussion board. Furthermore, bilibili.com provides one-to-one private messages among registered users. Bilibili.com‘s Business Model bilibili.com operates this online video community to achieve her commercialization goal, explained in the previous figure.Unregistered viewers come to bilibili.com due to word-of-mouth (WOM) of funny content or searching for content of their interests. A multiple-choice quiz of 100 questions is mandatory to become a registered member without charge, within 60 minutes on community rules and knowledge about anime, cartoons, and video games. This membership exam hopes to ensure community etiquette, loyalty, and stickiness. Note that content creators at least have the free membership.Registered users and content creators are retained by the online video community, i.e., interactions among content creators and users in social networks, and discussion boards around OGV and content creators’ uploaded PUGV.Additionally, bilibili.com provides auxiliary services for content creators, including influence and exposure promotion, monetization incentives, tutorials and seminars in video editing and recording, and data analysis for uploaded videos. bilibili.com‘s 2020 annual report says that the 3rd-month, 6th-month, 9th-month and 12th-month retention rate remained above 80%, for registered users who visited bilibili.com in each month since 2018. The “retention rate” of users who visit bilibili.com via mobile App or PC website in a given period, are to the percentage of these users who make at least one repeat visit after a certain duration; e.g., the “3rd-month retention rate” for users in a given month is the retention rate in the third month after the applicable month. bilibili.com then extracted revenue from retained users with four major sources, including mobile games affiliation, value-added service (premium membership subscription and tipping), advertising, and e-commerce (online shopping). Apparently, the success of bilibili.com‘s commercialization depends heavily on the community vibrancy and participation of retained users and content creators. Video Collaboration With the goal of boosting her online video community vibrancy, a feature called video collaboration was newly introduced on bilibili.com. In addition to a video published by a single content creator, bilibili.com allows a team of content creators to collaborate on one video, whose display page shows all team members with usernames, avatars, roles labeled, following buttons, and links to their personal page.The figure above shows the video display page of a collaborated video. For every team member, her personal page will exhibit this video, and all her followers will be notified of it once published via mobile phone notification and feed page. If a user follows multiple content creators in one team, this user will only receive one notification when this team newly publishes a video. Stakeholders in this online video community can be benefitted with good collaboration on video production.For participated content creators, a wider set of video skills can bring impossible content to life, more creators’ labor can lead to better content quality, and more followers’ being notified can increase video exposure and the chance of receiving followers.For the online video community, more followers’ being notified can contribute to community vibrancy by increasing the opportunity of interactions among content creators and users, and content creators in teams could establish belongingness and loyalty to the community by working together.And for users, more of them can be entertained and retained because of high content quality and vivacious community environment. Note that before the introduction of video collaboration on bilibili.com, content creators could still collaborate offline and upload their joint work by one content creator as the way of individual video production and display. For instance, the collaborated video in the figure above can be uploaded by only content creator CC1 as the way of individual video without video collaboration. However, the additional benefits, e.g., all team members, i.e., CC2 and CC3, listed on the video display page and every follower notified, are not available without the video collaboration characteristic.To boot, without video collaboration, CC1, CC2, and CC3 can separately publish this video, resulting in its exhibition on their personal page as individual work, and every follower will be notified. However, by doing so, community vibrancy metrics are also separately calculated for three videos of the same content but different uploaders, which decreases total video performance, the chance of video exposure, and the opportunity of attracting new followers, compared to the collaborated version. And for users who only follow CC1 but not CC2 or CC3, video collaboration can inform them of CC2 and CC3, and these users may become new followers of CC2 and CC3.Moreover, content creators in this team would establish additional belongingness and loyalty to the community by working together. unsplash-logothumbnail by Victor He","link":"/2021/04/03/Understanding-Bilibili-s-Business-Model/"},{"title":"Unlock Your Future: IS Academic Jobs for 2023-2024","text":"Redirecting...","link":"/2023/06/07/Unlock-Your-Future-IS-Academic-Jobs-for-2023-2024/"},{"title":"Yihong&#39;s MIS Ph.D. Reading List","text":"Redirecting...","link":"/2020/04/21/Yihong-MIS-Reading-List/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Ph.D.","slug":"Ph-D","link":"/tags/Ph-D/"},{"name":"Notes","slug":"Notes","link":"/tags/Notes/"},{"name":"Job","slug":"Job","link":"/tags/Job/"},{"name":"Interview Experiences","slug":"Interview-Experiences","link":"/tags/Interview-Experiences/"},{"name":"Writing","slug":"Writing","link":"/tags/Writing/"},{"name":"Latex","slug":"Latex","link":"/tags/Latex/"},{"name":"Packages","slug":"Packages","link":"/tags/Packages/"},{"name":"PGF&#x2F;TikZ","slug":"PGF-TikZ","link":"/tags/PGF-TikZ/"},{"name":"Doctoral Consortium","slug":"Doctoral-Consortium","link":"/tags/Doctoral-Consortium/"},{"name":"Reflection","slug":"Reflection","link":"/tags/Reflection/"},{"name":"Research","slug":"Research","link":"/tags/Research/"},{"name":"MIS","slug":"MIS","link":"/tags/MIS/"},{"name":"IS","slug":"IS","link":"/tags/IS/"},{"name":"Management Information Systems","slug":"Management-Information-Systems","link":"/tags/Management-Information-Systems/"},{"name":"Information Systems","slug":"Information-Systems","link":"/tags/Information-Systems/"},{"name":"Conference","slug":"Conference","link":"/tags/Conference/"},{"name":"Calendar","slug":"Calendar","link":"/tags/Calendar/"},{"name":"JSOM","slug":"JSOM","link":"/tags/JSOM/"},{"name":"SQL","slug":"SQL","link":"/tags/SQL/"},{"name":"ITSS3300","slug":"ITSS3300","link":"/tags/ITSS3300/"},{"name":"Math","slug":"Math","link":"/tags/Math/"},{"name":"Preliminary","slug":"Preliminary","link":"/tags/Preliminary/"},{"name":"Courses","slug":"Courses","link":"/tags/Courses/"},{"name":"Personalized Ranking","slug":"Personalized-Ranking","link":"/tags/Personalized-Ranking/"},{"name":"Implicit Feedback","slug":"Implicit-Feedback","link":"/tags/Implicit-Feedback/"},{"name":"Online Video Community","slug":"Online-Video-Community","link":"/tags/Online-Video-Community/"},{"name":"Bilibili","slug":"Bilibili","link":"/tags/Bilibili/"},{"name":"Business Model","slug":"Business-Model","link":"/tags/Business-Model/"},{"name":"Video Collaboration","slug":"Video-Collaboration","link":"/tags/Video-Collaboration/"},{"name":"哔哩哔哩","slug":"哔哩哔哩","link":"/tags/%E5%93%94%E5%93%A9%E5%93%94%E5%93%A9/"},{"name":"B站","slug":"B站","link":"/tags/B%E7%AB%99/"},{"name":"商业模型","slug":"商业模型","link":"/tags/%E5%95%86%E4%B8%9A%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B/"},{"name":"联合投稿","slug":"联合投稿","link":"/tags/%E8%81%94%E5%90%88%E6%8A%95%E7%A8%BF/"},{"name":"Reading","slug":"Reading","link":"/tags/Reading/"},{"name":"Publications","slug":"Publications","link":"/tags/Publications/"}],"categories":[{"name":"Ph.D.","slug":"Ph-D","link":"/categories/Ph-D/"},{"name":"Research","slug":"Ph-D/Research","link":"/categories/Ph-D/Research/"},{"name":"Notes","slug":"Ph-D/Notes","link":"/categories/Ph-D/Notes/"},{"name":"Courses","slug":"Ph-D/Courses","link":"/categories/Ph-D/Courses/"},{"name":"Writing","slug":"Ph-D/Writing","link":"/categories/Ph-D/Writing/"},{"name":"Doctoral Consortium","slug":"Ph-D/Research/Doctoral-Consortium","link":"/categories/Ph-D/Research/Doctoral-Consortium/"},{"name":"Job","slug":"Ph-D/Notes/Job","link":"/categories/Ph-D/Notes/Job/"},{"name":"Conference","slug":"Ph-D/Research/Conference","link":"/categories/Ph-D/Research/Conference/"},{"name":"TA","slug":"Ph-D/Notes/TA","link":"/categories/Ph-D/Notes/TA/"},{"name":"Latex","slug":"Ph-D/Writing/Latex","link":"/categories/Ph-D/Writing/Latex/"},{"name":"PGF&#x2F;TikZ","slug":"Ph-D/Writing/Latex/PGF-TikZ","link":"/categories/Ph-D/Writing/Latex/PGF-TikZ/"},{"name":"Job","slug":"Ph-D/Job","link":"/categories/Ph-D/Job/"},{"name":"Reading","slug":"Ph-D/Reading","link":"/categories/Ph-D/Reading/"}],"pages":[{"title":"My CV","text":"","link":"/cv/index.html"},{"title":"Miscellaneous","text":"Hobbies ✨Travel 🗺️ &amp; Photograph 📸Photo contrains not only digital pixels, but also life stories and emotions. Running 🏃I used to be a fat boy since I started my first year in SHUFE. Some day in a winter, I found myself quite out of breath while stepping upstairs. How uncomfortable and unhealthy would I be after 10 years if I keep these fat along with my body? I just told my self I gotta keep slim and I started to execrise. Fisrt, I decided to run around the campus and during long vacations I ran in a park near my home. Every time I run, 5 km was a baseline. And in 2017, it took me nearly 63.5 hours, which is 570 km in total. I tried half marathon (21 km) twice and I really hope I can challenge a ful marathon myself someday.

The innovative idea of employing information technology to link people online and make the world a big party motivated me to explore this field. Consequently, I acknowledged information technology as a challenging but influential field. I could utilize up-to-date technologies to discover the digital world and tackle critical issues encountered in various domains. My interest in MIS continued to grow in my first undergraduate class in Machine Learning after I learned the power and commercial value of Facebook. Different unsupervised and supervised algorithms immediately captured my attention. I cannot help learning more in-depth algorithms and putting them into practice. As my undergraduate progressed, I enrolled in the School of Information Management and Engineering (SIME) Honors Program at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SHUFE). This program provided me with a higher-level curriculum (e.g., Linear and Nonlinear Programming, Advanced Operation Research, and Stochastic Processes). The most valuable trait I learned from my undergraduate study is always maintaining a thirst for knowing more. When I practiced what I learned in lessons or tried out new skills from the latest research papers, I always found certain limitations of my current knowledge. My hungry mind encouraged me to discover more. My endeavor to review extensive literature, derive math formulas, and conduct experiments was worth the effort as I made continuous progress. Besides the satisfaction I earned, I realize that MIS is not merely about programming and importing modules and packages. As the lifeblood of business, researchers in this field involve themselves in behavioral, technical, analytical, and empirical sub-problems by recognizing and conceptualizing critical key questions and employing various methodologies across disciplines.","link":"/about/index.html"}]}
